# Init Odin Project

Convenient script to quickly generate a new [Odin](https://odin-lang.com/) project.

I used this to easily setup a new [raylib](https://raylib.com/) project, especially when used raylib dynamically so I don't have to copy raylib's dll manually everytime I want to create a new one.

## Usage

### Call from anywhere from command line

- Copy `iop.bat` to a folder reachable via path system environment. If you have Odin added to path system environment, you can also put iop in Odin's folder.

- Call `iop` from command line to create a new project.

### Projects folder

- Create a new folder where you will store all your Odin project.

- Copy `iop.bat` to that folder.

- Double click on `iop.bat` to create a new project.
